# MathieuFunctions.jl

Julia package for Mathieu functions.

Mathieu functions are the eigenvalues and eigenfunction of *Mathieu's
equation* (for more details, see [NIST's Digital Library of
Mathematical Functions](http://dlmf.nist.gov/28)).

## Implementation

This implementation is based on an algorhtm described by Shirts, which
revolves around an application of Floquet's theorem. Interestingly, an
equivalent description can be obtained by considering the eigenstates
and eigenenergies of a particular type of artificial atom based on
superconducting circuits (see Cotet's Ph.D. thesis for a discussion of
this connection, or a recent paper on a more modern implementation of
a device known as a "transmon"). In this physical picture, Mathieu
functions can be approximated by computing the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian truncated to a sufficiently high
dimension (this Hamiltonian corresponds to a symmetric tri-diagonal
matrix, so this approximation is rather convenient for numerics).

The current tests consist of checks against a table generated by
Mathematica (which, to our knowledge, has the most complete
implementation of Mathieu functions amongst commonly accessible
mathematical software packages).

## Mathieu equation characteristic values (eigenvalues)

We follow the notation used in NIST's Digital Library of Mathematical Functions, 

| DLMF | Julia call | Description | 
|------|------------|-------------|
| aⱼ(q)  | `charA(q,j)` | Integer order Mathieu characteristic value of even parity | 
| bⱼ(q)  | `charB(q,j)` | Integer order Mathieu characteristic value of odd parity |
| λ₍ᵥ₊ⱼ₎(q) | `charλ(q,v,j)`  | Real-valued order Mathieu characteristic value |

For integer order characteristic values, our implementation yields

which should be contrasted with the [corresponding plot in the DTMF @ NIST](http://dlmf.nist.gov/28.2.F1.mag).

Similarly, for real-valued order, our implementatio yiels

which should be contrasted with the [corresponding plot in the DTMF @ NIST](http://dlmf.nist.gov/28.13.F1.mag).

## Application: Eigenstates and energies for transmon and quantronium qubits

Thanks to the way that the Mathieu characteristic values are computed, the
order indexing convention used here is particularly convenient for computing
the energy spectrum of a broad class of superconducting qubits including the 
[quantronium](http://www.phys.ens.fr/~cottet/ACottetThesis.pdf) and the 
[transmon](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703002).

As an example of how this package may be used, here is the Julia code
that reproduces the energy spectrum illustrated in [Koch et al.]().

```julia
using MathieuFunction, PyPlot

EJoverEC = 30;
EC       = 1; # GHz
nLevels  = 10;
nCharge  = 2; 
nData    = 1001;

Nstart = 5;

q = -(1/2)*EJoverEC;
tol = 1e-12;

ng = linspace(-nCharge,nCharge,nData);
nu = -2*ng;

a = zeros(nData,nLevels);
N = zeros(nData,1);
Err = zeros(nData,1);
for i=1:nData
    #println(nu[i])
    a[i,:] = charλ(q,nu[i],k=1:nLevels);
end

E = EC*a;
Eng_half = charλ(q,-1,k=1:nLevels);
Eng_0    = charλ(q, 0,k=1:nLevels);
E01      = Eng_half[2] - Eng_half[1];

plot(ng,(E-Eng_0[1])/E01);
ylim(-.5,5)
```
