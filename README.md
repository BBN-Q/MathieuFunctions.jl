# MathieuFunctions.jl

Julia package for Mathieu functions.

Mathieu functions are the eigenvalues and eigenfunction of *Mathieu's
equation* (for more details, see [NIST's Digital Library of
Mathematical Functions](http://dlmf.nist.gov/28)).

This implementation is based on an algorhtm described by Shirts, which
revolves around an application of Floquet's theorem. Interestingly, an
equivalent description can be obtained by considering the eigenstates
and eigenenergies of a particular type of artificial atom based on
superconducting circuits (see Cotet's Ph.D. thesis for a discussion of
this connection, or a recent paper on a more modern implementation of
a device known as a "transmon"). In this physical picture, Mathieu
functions can be approximated by computing the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian truncated to a sufficiently high
dimension (this Hamiltonian corresponds to a symmetric tri-diagonal
matrix, so this approximation is rather convenient for numerics).

The current tests consist of checks against a table generated by
Mathematica (which, to our knowledge, has the most complete
implementation of Mathieu functions amongst commonly accessible
mathematical software packages).

## Mathieu equation characteristic values (eigenvalues)

| DLMF | Julia call |
|------|------------|
| aⱼ(q)  | `characteristicA(q,j)`
| bⱼ(q)  | `characteristicB(q,j)`
| λ₍ᵥ₊ⱼ₎(q) | `characteristicλ(q,v,j)`

## Application: Eigenstates and energies for transmon and quantronium qubits
